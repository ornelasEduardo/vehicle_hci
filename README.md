# Tesla Model 3 Display using Gestured Shortcuts as Navigation Method

This is a working prototype of Tesla's Model 3 display that utilizes HammerJS for touch gesture reading. The prototype is intended to be ran off a tablet similar to the iPad Pro 12.1 inch model. 

# Current Gestures

Currently, there are 4 gestures that are recongized by the prototype and both require 2 fingers to work. Left and Right swipes will iterate through views - which currently are only the home and music views - in a carousel fashion. Panning Up and Down will bring up the volumen slider and increase or decrease based on the direction of the pan.
